# My personal website

Pretty simple website. I don't have enough time to maintain all the dependencies so for this one I decided to use as less dependencies as possible.

### Getting started

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm start

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
